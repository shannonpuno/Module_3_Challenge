# Password Generator Starter Code

## User Story
AS A web developer with access to JavaScript

I WANT to create a webpage that will generate a password that meets certain criteria

SO THAT users can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a starter code

WHEN I see that I have a starter code for HTML, CSS, and Javascript

THEN I will start by writing out variables for an array that include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

WHEN I declared the variables

THEN I will create a function to build prompts for the user to confirm the length of the password and what characters will be included

WHEN I have created the loop for the prompts

THEN I will create character options based on the user input 

WHEN all various options have been created I will use them to generate the password using for loop

THEN I will test run to see if my webapplication can generate a password based on the prompt answers. 

It is done when webapplication can generate password and is deployed.
